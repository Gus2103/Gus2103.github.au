											<h3>Why I decided to be a teacher</h3>
											<p>I didn't decide to be a teacher until about term 1 of year 12 in 2020, For a long time I was
											throwing around lots of ideas of what I could potentially do, go into finance, be a tradie etc,
											but I've always thought that I couldn't handle an office job because I just thought it'd be boring,
											which made me think of entering the trades but then I realised that not only could I not do the early
											mornings, but I don't think my body could cope with the job itself. Thats when it hit me, I could do
											teaching to inspire the next few generations to keep carpentry going as an important life skill, as 
											well as a hobby. My main inspiration to become a teacher was my Year 12 timber teacher, who really
											helped me produce an amazing majorwork, which made me want to do the same for others.</p>

												<h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Teaching.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>As a 21-year-old woodwork teacher, I believe that teaching is about more than just imparting 
											technical skillsâ€”it's about inspiring creativity, fostering a love for craftsmanship, and 
											encouraging a mindset of curiosity and resilience. I see myself not just as an instructor but as 
											a mentor who guides students in discovering their potential through hands-on learning and 
											exploration.<p>
											
											<p>In my woodwork classes, I aim to create an environment that is both safe and inspiring. I 
											understand that working with tools and materials can be intimidating for some, so I focus on 
											building a foundation of safety and confidence. By teaching my students how to properly use and 
											respect the tools of the trade, I help them develop a sense of responsibility and pride in their 
											work.<p>
											
											<p>I am committed to fostering an inclusive classroom where every student feels valued and supported. 
											I believe that diversity in thought, experience, and perspective enriches the learning environment, 
											and I strive to create a space where all students can express their ideas and creativity. I 
											encourage collaboration and peer learning, understanding that we all have something to learn from 
											one another.<p>
											
											<p>My teaching philosophy centres on the importance of process over product. While I aim to help my 
											students create beautiful and functional pieces, I also want them to appreciate the journey of 
											learning, problem-solving, and personal growth that occurs along the way. I believe that mistakes 
											are valuable learning opportunities, and I encourage my students to take risks, experiment, and 
											learn from their experiences.<p>
											
											<p>As a woodwork teacher, I am passionate about the power of craftsmanship to teach patience, 
											attention to detail, and perseverance. I believe that through working with their hands, students 
											can develop a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. My goal is to help them 
											cultivate a lifelong love for creating and to empower them to apply the skills and values they learn 
											in the workshop to other areas of their lives.<p>
											
											<p>Ultimately, I see teaching as a way to inspire and nurture the next generation of makers and thinkers. 
											I am dedicated to helping my students not only develop their technical skills but also grow as 
											confident, creative, and thoughtful individuals.</p>

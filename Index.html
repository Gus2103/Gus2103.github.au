											<h3>Family life</h3>
											<p>I currently live at home in Sydney with my mum, dad and older sister, we also have three amazing
											dogs, a golden retriever named Harry, Miniature lassie named Benson and a cavalier named Gilbert.
											Funnily enough Gilbert was actually named after my grandfather who's name was Gilbert Charles King,
											and Gilberts full breed name is a King Charles Cavalier, naming him this definitely helped to 
											convince mum to keep him. But of all 3 dogs, Harry the retriever is my favourite because he gives
											the best cuddles. (The other 2 shelties in the photo below are my cousins, Benson is the one in the 
											bottom right corner). </p>

												<h2>About Me</h2>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Fish.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>This photo was taken of me up at the family holiday house, as you might be able to tell, I
											like fishing, this particular fish I caught is a special memory of mine because it's the biggest
											flatty (Flathead Fish) I have ever caught as well as breaking an overall record for the biggest
											fish that's ever been caught off our ramp. The hat I'm wearing also symbolises my favourite footy 
											team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs.
											</p>

											<h3>My Hobbies and interests</h3>
											<p>My name is Gus and I'm 21 years old, I am currently studying to become a teacher at the 
											Australian Catholic University (ACU) in Strathfield. He has chosen to specialise in teaching
											industrial technology, specifically timber, where I enjoy learning about woodworking, carpentry,
											and all things related to working with wood. I am passionate about passing on my knowledge and
											skills to future generations, hoping to inspire a love for hands-on craftsmanship in my future 
											students.</p>

											<p>Outside of my studies, I'm really passionate about rugby. Whether it's playing a match or 
											watching rugby union or league, I can't get enough of the sport. I also love being outdoors and 
											spending time in nature. There's nothing better than going camping, exploring new trails, or 
											going off-roading with mates. Whether I'm tackling a challenging woodworking project or enjoying 
											the great outdoors, I'm always up for an adventure.</p>
